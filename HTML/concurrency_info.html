                <h1>Principles of Concurrency</h1>
                <h3>Both interleaved and overlapped processes can be viewed as examples of concurrent processes, they
                    both present the same problems.</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>The relative speed of execution cannot be predicted. It depends on the following: </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Activities of other processes</li>
                    <li>The way the operating system handles interrupts</li>
                    <li>The scheduling policies of the operating system</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Problems in Concurrency</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Sharing Global Resources</h2>
                        <p>Sharing global resources safely is difficult. If two processes both make use of a global
                            variable and both perform read and write on that variable, then the order in which various
                            read and write are executed is critical.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Optimal allocation of resources </h2>
                        <p>It is difficult for the operating system to manage the allocation of resources optimally.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Locating programming errors</h2>
                        <p>It is very difficult to locate a programming error because reports are usually not
                            reproducible.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Locking the channel</h2>
                        <p>It may be inefficient for the operating system to simply lock the channel and prevents its
                            use by other processes.</p>

                <h1>Advantages of Concurrency</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Running of multiple applications</h2>
                        <p>It enables us to run multiple applications at the same time.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Better resource utilization</h2>
                        <p>It enables the resources that are unused by one application to be used for other
                            applications.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Better average response time</h2>
                        <p>Without concurrency, each application has to be run to completion before the next one can be
                            run.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Better Performance</h2>
                        <p>It enables better performance by the operating system. When one application uses only the
                            processor and another application uses only the disk drive then the time to run both
                            applications concurrently to completion will be shorter
                            than the time to run each application consecutively.</p>

                        <h2>Non-Atomic</h2>
                        <p>Operations that are non-atomic but interruptible by multiple processes can cause problems.

                        <h2>Race Condition</h2>
                        <p>A race condition occurs when the outcome depends on which of several processes gets to a
                            point first.</p>

                        <h2>Blocking</h2>
                        <p>Processes can block waiting for resources. A process could be blocked for a long period
                            waiting for input from a terminal. If the process is required to periodically update some
                            data, this would be very undesirable.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Starvation</h2>
                        <p>It occurs when a process does not obtain service to progress.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h2>Deadlock</h2>
                        <p>It occurs when two processes are blocked hence neither can proceed.</p>
