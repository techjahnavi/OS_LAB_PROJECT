            <h2>Explanation</h2>
            <p>In Process Synchronization, Test and Set Lock (TSL) is a synchronization mechanism that uses a
                test-and-set instruction to provide the synchronization among the processes.</p>
            <p>Mutual Exclusion is guaranteed in TSL mechanism since a process can never be preempted just before
                setting the lock variable. Only one process can see the lock variable as 0 at a particular time and
                that's why, the mutual exclusion is guaranteed.</p>
            <p>In computer science, the test-and-set instruction is an instruction used to write (set) 1 to a memory
                location and return its old value as a single atomic (i.e., non-interruptible) operation. The caller can
                then "test" the result to see if
                the state was changed by the call. If multiple processes may access the same memory location, and if a
                process is currently performing a test-and-set, no other process may begin another test-and-set until
                the first process's test-and-set
                is finished. A CPU may use a test-and-set instruction offered by another electronic component, such as
                dual-port RAM; a CPU itself may also offer a test-and-set instruction.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h2>Variation 1</h2>
            <p>When CPU 1 issues a test-and-set instruction, the DPRAM first makes an "internal note" of this by storing
                the address of the memory location in a special place. If at this point, CPU 2 happens to issue a
                test-and-set instruction for the same
                memory location, the DPRAM first checks its "internal note", recognizes the situation, and issues a BUSY
                interrupt, which tells CPU 2 that it must wait and retry. This is an implementation of a busy waiting or
                spinlock using the interrupt
                mechanism. Since all this happens at hardware speeds, CPU 2's wait to get out of the spin-lock is very
                short.</p>
            <p>Whether or not CPU 2 was trying to access the memory location, the DPRAM performs the test given by CPU
                1. If the test succeeds, the DPRAM sets the memory location to the value given by CPU 1. Then the DPRAM
                wipes out its "internal note" that
                CPU 1 was writing there. At this point, CPU 2 could issue a test-and-set, which would succeed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h2>Variation 2</h2>
            <p>CPU 1 issues a test-and-set instruction to write to "memory location A". The DPRAM does not immediately
                store the value in memory location A, but instead simultaneously moves the current value to a special
                register, while setting the contents
                of memory location A to a special "flag value". If at this point, CPU 2 issues a test-and-set to memory
                location A, the DPRAM detects the special flag value, and as in Variation 1, issues a BUSY interrupt.
            </p>
            <p>Whether or not CPU 2 was trying to access the memory location, the DPRAM now performs CPU 1's test. If
                the test succeeds, the DPRAM sets memory location A to the value specified by CPU 1. If the test fails,
                the DPRAM copies the value back
                from the special register to memory location A. Either operation wipes out the special flag value. If
                CPU 2 now issues a test-and-set, it will succeed.</p>
