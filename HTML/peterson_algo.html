            <h2>Explanation</h2>
            <p>Peterson's Algorithm is used to synchronize two processes. It uses two variables, a bool array flag of
                size 2 and an int variable turn to accomplish it.</p>
            <p>In the solution i represents the Consumer and j represents the Producer. Initially the flags are false.
                When a process wants to execute it's critical section, it sets it's flag to true and turn as the index
                of the other process. This means
                that the process wants to execute but it will allow the other process to run first. The process performs
                busy waiting until the other process has finished it's own critical section.</p>
            <p>After this the current process enters it's critical section and adds or removes a random number from the
                shared buffer. After completing the critical section, it sets it's own flag to false, indication it does
                not wish to execute anymore.</p>
            <p>The program runs for a fixed amount of time before exiting. This time can be changed by changing value of
                the macro RT.</p>
