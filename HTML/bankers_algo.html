            <h2>Explanation</h2>
            <p>The banker's algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by
                simulating the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes an
                “s-state” check to test for possible
                activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.</p>
            <p>Banker's algorithm is named so because it is used in banking system to check whether loan can be
                sanctioned to a person or not. Suppose there are n number of account holders in a bank and the total sum
                of their money is S. If a person applies
                for a loan then the bank first subtracts the loan amount from the total money that bank has and if the
                remaining amount is greater than S then only the loan is sanctioned. It is done because if all the
                account holders comes to withdraw
                their money then the bank can easily do it.</p>
            <p>After this the current process enters it's critical section and adds or removes a random number from the
                shared buffer. After completing the critical section, it sets it's own flag to false, indication it does
                not wish to execute anymore.</p>
            <p>The program runs for a fixed amount of time before exiting. This time can be changed by changing value of
                the macro RT.</p>

            <h2>Advantages</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>It contains various resources that meet the requirements of each process.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Each process should provide information to the operating system for upcoming resource requests,
                        the number of resources, and how long the resources will be held.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It helps the operating system manage and control process requests for each type of resource in
                        the computer system.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The algorithm has a Max resource attribute that represents indicates each process can hold the
                        maximum number of resources in a system.></p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>It requires a fixed number of processes, and no additional processes can be started in the system
                        while executing the process</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The algorithm does no longer allows the processes to exchange its maximum needs while processing
                        its tasks.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Each process has to know and state their maximum resource requirement in advance for the system.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The number of resource requests can be granted in a finite time, but the time limit for
                        allocating the resources is one year.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
