                <h1>Principles of Deadlock</h1>
                <br>
                <h3>Deadlock is a situation where a set of processes are blocked because each process is holding a
                    resource and waiting for another resource acquired by some other process.</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>A process in operating system uses resources in the following way: </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Requests a resource </li>
                    <li>Uses the resource</li>
                    <li>Releases the resource</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <h3>Consider an example when two trains are coming toward each other on the same track and there is only
                    one track, none of the trains can move once they are in front of each other. A similar situation
                    occurs in operating systems when there are
                    two or more processes that hold some resources and wait for resources held by other(s). For example,
                    in the below diagram, Process 1 is holding Resource 1 and waiting for resource 2 which is acquired
                    by process 2, and process 2 is waiting
                    for resource 1.</h3>

                        <p>One or more than one resources are non-shareable (only one process can usea a particular
                            resource at a time).</p>

                        <h2>No Pre-emption</h2>

                <h1>Methods for handling Deadlock</h1>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Deadlock prevention or avoidance</h2>
                        <p>The idea is to not let the system into a deadlock state. One can zoom into each category
                            individually, Prevention is done by negating one of above mentioned necessary conditions for
                            deadlock.</p>
                        <p>We need to ensure that all information about resources that the process will need are known
                            to us prior to the execution of the process.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2> Deadlock detection and recovery</h2>
                        <p>Let deadlock occur, then do preemption to handle it once occurred</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Ignore the problem altogether</h2>
                        <p>If deadlock is very rare, then let it happen and reboot the system. This is the approach that
                            both Windows and UNIX take.</p>
