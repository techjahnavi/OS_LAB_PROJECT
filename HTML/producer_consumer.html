            <h2>Explanation</h2>
            <p>The Producer-Consumer problem is a classic problem this is used for multi-process synchronization i.e.
                synchronization between more than one processes.</p>
            <p>In the producer-consumer problem, there is one Producer that is producing something and there is one
                Consumer that is consuming the products produced by the Producer. The producers and consumers share the
                same memory buffer that is of fixed-size.</p>
            <p>The job of the Producer is to generate the data, put it into the buffer, and again start generating data.
                While the job of the Consumer is to consume the data from the buffer.</p>
            <p>The producer should produce data only when the buffer is not full. If the buffer is full, then the
                producer shouldn't be allowed to put any data into the buffer.</p>
            <p>The consumer should consume data only when the buffer is not empty. If the buffer is empty, then the
                consumer shouldn't be allowed to take any data from the buffer.</p>
            <p>The producer and consumer should not access the buffer at the same time.</p>
